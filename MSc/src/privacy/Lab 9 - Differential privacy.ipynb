    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential Privacy is a critical concept in modern machine learning.The primary goal of machine learning models is to learn useful patterns that generalize well, enabling accurate predictions and decisions on unseen data. As discussed in previous labs, deep learning models often contain millions of parameters, which can lead to overfitting due to the \"memorization\" of information within these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This memorization poses a significant risk: sensitive or private information from the training dataset can inadvertently be encoded into the model, potentially harming individual privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential Privacy aims to address this issue by ensuring that models do not reveal specific details about individuals in the training data while still learning meaningful and generalizable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The general assumption is that an adversary has access to the trained model, including its complete structure and the values of all parameters. Under these conditions, we must ensure that the adversary cannot extract sensitive information about individuals in the dataset. The most common privacy-related concerns include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Membership Inference Attacks**  \n",
    "   - **Goal**: Determine if a specific individual's data was included in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reconstruction Attacks**  \n",
    "   - **Goal**: Reconstruct sensitive features of individuals whose data contributed to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed overview of these and other related concerns, refer to this resource: [Understanding Privacy Risks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11819)."
